# Bake-Safety-Gear
This project which is the team’s inception, is related to the safety of bikers and motorcyclists alike.
The Bike Gear Assistant is a helmet comprising of sensory and visual feedback of the traffic outside of the biker’s peripheral vision.
It consists of 4 different systems working in conjunction to one another:
Ultrasonic distance detection system- to detect any oncoming traffic and send the data to the processor.
Haptic feedback system- to give the vibrational feedback pulses inversely proportional to the distance detected by the ultrasonic detection system.
Heads-Up display- to give the real-time video of the rear-view projected in 3D space using virtual-image optics.
Real-time camera feed- to capture and provide rear view video on the heads-up display
